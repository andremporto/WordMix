The game will show players a random eight-letter word, and ask them to make words out of it.

## Our Goal

For example, if the starter word is “alarming” they might spell “alarm”, “ring”, “main”, and so on.

## What I learn

- List
- onAppear()
- Bundle
- fatalError()
- @State, NavigationView
- Error handling in Swift.
- Code refactoring.
- Basic debugging.
